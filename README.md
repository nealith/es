# This is a AR student project

The project attempt to show a 3D tanks over a matching stats card from the miniatures game *Tanks*
Our work is based on [a tutoral from Juan Gallostra AcÃ­n](https://bitesofcode.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/augmented-reality-with-python-and-opencv-part-1/)

# Get started

You need to install OpenCV (version > 3)  with python API first

``` bash
# pip install PyWavefront pyglet pillow
$ clone https://github.com/nealith/es.git
$ cd es/src
$ python ar_tp.py
```

You need to print cards from the folder *references*, can work in grey level

# Satus

The process is unstable, probably due to the interests points extraction step. 2 Tanks avaibles : Cromwell and T34/85
